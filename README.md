 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.
